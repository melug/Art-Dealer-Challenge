# Art-Dealer-Challenge
Simulation of Art Dealer Challenge (Fort Alten)

Objective of this simulation is not about solving the challenge, rather I focused on haskell code. 

I tried to achieve series of objectives:

1. Abstract the problem as much as possible
2. Create data structure whenever it is possible
